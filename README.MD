- This is a website for learning purposes

- Using neural network for learning then recognizing the hand written digit (mnist dataset)
- Train model using python: train_model.py
- Using tfjs to use model on website 

- First idea: sketch web app
- Following instruction of: [this repo](https://github.com/maneprajakta/Digit_Recognition_Web_App/tree/master) for how to use tfjs
